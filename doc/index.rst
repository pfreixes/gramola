Gramola
========

Gramola is a Python application used as a console or library tool to view or use the time series 
data points got from your favourite time series data base.

As a console tool can be seen as a Grafana_ port to visualize the data behind a metric namespaces 
using a scaled graphic. Aside of the console tool, Gramola is also used as a Python library, 
allowing us to use the data behind the metric namespaces to perform desired actions by the user code.
